1. At source A, the popular jobs are marketing and IT development
2. At source B; for the remote access VPN process,the software and network access server will use hash function to secure VPN link is safe like SSL function. It will make information cannot be read but the application still can read it.When they start work, first, software will start link server and give it target website and the server will take the web information and return to client software. Because this process can hide origin IP place, so the VPN always use to change user IP soace.

     At source C and D they both say digital nomad is a important job, both say they can work at any place and they can learn many skill. For different, at source C, author use personal view to talk digital nomad can work at any place and study many skill but at source D, author use country view and company view to talk it. In source C, author say they can working and traveling, but source D haven't say it.
4. For me, I'm agree company make people work at home. At the source A, we can the most popular job is IT development, this job need use laptop and ideas. It give company enough motivation becuse the they can work online and take ideas at his life. So if company start work at home, this job can take more help. If you scare people work online is unsafe, at the source B, private VPN can solve this question. Becuase it through encode technology to make sure hack can take important information if they hacking the internet. Of course, digital nomad still a nice life, they have a freelife  and solve employ question. Actually, most people think they can work at any times so The business man shouldn't make a big house and each worker will spand time goto company. These workers can work at home, use internet show his work.
