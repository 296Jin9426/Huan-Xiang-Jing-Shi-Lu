[^1]:present: 介绍

Transport question is a big question that effect human spend more time for walk. For this essay, I will show digital transport system is a good system that people can easy control the correct time that they can see bus.

Becuase it is application, so there has three advantages and three disadvantages. The advantages are the everyone can download to use it, it cannot spend hugh to build it because it i only take the bus data to do a tiny calculate that it will send result to users and it would give a better serve to users that the company can take more income.

For the disadvatages, first, each user should have smart phone that if company public this app, it is unbalance for some users that they haven't smart phone such as the elders; nest, it will increase the time people use digital device that it is not good them eyes; finial, if one application want to have enough income that it should has hugh user so the bus company should have enough people use. It has one example is "上海公交"app, this app can the coordinate of each local bus and tell users what's the nearest bus and which bus they can set in if they want to a place. In ShangHai, it has 2 million people will set in bus per day, that why this app can public to people.
