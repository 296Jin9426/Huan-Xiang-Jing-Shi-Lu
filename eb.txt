Another quote is "he took hold of Shmuel's tiny hand in his and squeezed it tightly," this shows that Burno trusts Shmuel very much, and he really want to protect his best friend. I feel so sad  when I read this line. "'You're my best friends, Shumel',he said. 'My best friend for life.'" Bruno didin't know that they are both in danger. They hold hands together until "the room went very dark " I can image that Burno and Shumel are feeling very scared because they died together. This makes me think about the English B theme "experiences" because everybody must experience fear and death. I also feel very sad that two boys are so young when they died. As children they should be happy

I would talk about book The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne. this book had talk the story of World War 2, Nazi Germany would killed Jawish and the main character are both at this times. Bruno and Shmuel, they are the best friends and both 9 years old. In the book, Bruno crosses the fence and help Shmuel to finding father Bruno is a German boy, he lives with his family at his new house. His father is' a powerful man, he would manage many armors working at the concentration.

In this scene, Bruno went to meet Shumuel to help he find his father. In this scene, it was raining and Bruno feel very cold. The rain made me think about problem is coming. Bruno say "'I'm sorry we didin't find your papa'"this part shows Bruno is very kind, carry, supportive and helpful friend. The two boys are just children who want to play together. They don't know anything about the war and Bruno doesn't know that his father is killing all the Jews.

I would talk about The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne. This book had talked about the story of World War 2, Nazi Germany would kill Jewish people, and the main characters are both at this time. Bruno and Shmuel, they are the best friends and both 9 years old. In the book, Bruno crosses the fence and helps Shmuel find his father. Bruno is a German boy; he lives with his family at his new house. His father is' a powerful man; he would manage many armors working at the concentration.

In this scene, Bruno's father had arguing with Lieutenant Kolter, the guys are cry and the man are angry. At this part, everyone is talking but they have different target. Father is angry for Lieutenant Kolter and mother, Gretel want to travel and Bruno is confuse. It shows us the real social level of Germany that father higher than mother, mother higher than children and children higher than staff. 

There has one centence significant is "Eat your dinner". this centence is from mother and repeats many times and the reason she will command her children is because the discussing between father and Lieutenant Kolter is no good for the children. This part thought a dinner party show Bruno's father isn't good.
